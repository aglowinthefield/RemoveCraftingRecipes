# Remove Crafting Recipes - Synthesis Patcher

## Purpose
Install lots of clothing mods and find that your forge is cluttered with items you'll only ever add with AddItemMenu or QUI?

This is for you! This patcher will remove crafting recipes and, optionally, tempering recipes for mods you specify in settings.

By default this patcher will do nothing and error. You'll want to specify at least one mod otherwise uh, what are you doin'?

## Usage

Options are as follows

- **Mods to Trim** - Add the mods for which you no longer want crafting recipes here.
- **Remove Tempering** - Optionally remove tempering recipes from the mod as well. Maybe you don't plan on sharpening your t-shirt.
